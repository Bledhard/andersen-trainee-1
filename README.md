# ASP&#46;NET + Angular test project

The only purpose of this project is to simulate simplified project, to be able to work with main techniques than will be need later at real project and gain knowledge about main things in MVC ASP&#46;NET project.

Here are:
 - Simple local SQL DB with 3 Tables:
   - Customers;
   - Wallets;
   - Transactions;
 - Back-end part:
   - Services, that get data from DB and return it as request further;
   - Classes, that create objects for each entity in DB;
   - Controllers, that handle request and return response;
 - Front-end part:
   - HTML templates;
   - CSS stylesheets;
   - Angular typesscript files;

There's still a lot to do, but because of lack of time at August 2017 I've finished work with this project, making stable front-end part connected to DB through back-end logic.
